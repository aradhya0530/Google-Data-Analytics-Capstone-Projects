## Cyclistic: How does bike-share company navigate speedy success

### Background

600 docking stations and more than 5,800 bicycles are part of this bike-sharing programme. By further providing reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, Cyclistic distinguishes itself from the competition and broadens the appeal of bike sharing to riders with impairments and others who are unable to utilise a conventional two-wheeled bike. About 8% of riders choose assistive bikes, whereas the majority ride standard bikes. Although 30% of cyclists use them as a daily form of transportation to get to work, they are more likely to cycle for recreation.

Moreno (Director of Marketing) has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

### Analysis

In order to analyze the usage pattern of casual and annual members, historical data has been fetched from this [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). This URL consists of 12 months' data of rides of both annual and casual members.
